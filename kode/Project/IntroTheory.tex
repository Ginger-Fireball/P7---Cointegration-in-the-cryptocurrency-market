Given a time series $X_t$ if stationarity is achieved trough differencing, but a linear combination of the time series $\alpha X$ also gives a stationary time series, the time series is said to be co-integrated. When looking at the long run equilibrium of the the co-integrated time series it has to give a finite variance. From this it can be concluded that deviations form the equilibrium are stationary.
