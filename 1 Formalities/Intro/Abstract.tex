This project's subject is financial modeling and applied econometrics. The project examines cointegration between four different cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple. The analysis amounts in an application were the forecasts were made both pairwise and simultaneously for all four. 

The analysis were made based on time series theory, which included theory regarding cointegration and theory for testing of it's existence. The theory regarding testing for cointegration included the Engle-Granger test and the Johansen test. 

The application investigates the closing prices in the time period from the 10th of December 2020 to the 10th of October 2024. This will investigated by the use of the described theory, model fitting, and model validation. 




% The fundamental subject of this project

% is empirical financial modelling and ap-
% plied econometrics. This project inves-
% tigates cointegration among four differ-
% ent cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Lite-
% coin, Ethereum, and ZCash. The pur-
% pose of this analysis is to provide better

% forecasts of either of the four, both pair-
% wise and simultaneously. The analysis is

% made by introducing time series theory,
% including theory regarding cointegration,
% and how to formally test for its existence.

% The theory about cointegration testing in-
% cludes both the Engle-Granger and Jo-
% hansen test. The chosen data in the ap-
% plication contains daily closing prices from

% the 16th of October 2018 to the 30th of
% September 2021. This will be examined by
% using the described theory, model fitting
% and model evaluation, as well as coding in
% R.
