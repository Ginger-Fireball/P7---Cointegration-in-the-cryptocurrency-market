\chapter{Discussion}
Looking back at the introduction and problem statement this project has succeeded in describing, answering and resolving some of the complications that could arise when forecasting the closing prices of cryptocurrencies. This discussion will aim to recap what has been achieved throughout the application and in addition consider different possibilities of improving the model.\\
Initially what should be considered is the different levels of values in cryptocurrencies where a solution such as logging the prices could eliminate some of the extremes. This process can although give skewed conclusions as to a log-transformed relation could occur even though the non logged would not or vice versa because of the log being non linear. Hence a cointegrating or non cointegrating relation between two logged prices might be obtained without the same relation seen for the prices in levels. It is common practice to, when looking at economic variables, take the logarithm of the values but issues can arise in cointegrating relations \cite{cointegrationloggedissues}.\\
As mentioned in Section \ref{sect:johansen test} in order for Johansen to asymptotically hold then the errors are assumed to be normally distributed. In Chapter \ref{chap:dataanlysis} tests as the Ljung-Box test and QQ-plots indicate XXX-----HAR VI UNCORRELATED ERRORS NORMALFORDELT OSV-----XXX\\
