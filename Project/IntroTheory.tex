\chapter{intro}
Spurious regression is a random relationship which can occur when analyzing time series. It occurs when there seems to be a relation between two time series and when such relation occurs, especially if the time series observed are non-stationary, there is a risk for it being a spurious regression. The issue with spurious regression is that it insinuates that two time series, which are not related, has a correlation.\\\\
Naturally there are multiple cases where cointegration is present and a significant factor, hence cases where the relation is reliable and one series has an impact on the other and vice versa. This eventually propose 

This chapter is based on \cite{co-Integration_and_error_correction}.

Given a time series $X_t$ if stationarity is achieved trough differencing, but a linear combination of the time series $\alpha X$ also gives a stationary time series, the time series is said to be co-integrated. When looking at the long run equilibrium of the the co-integrated time series it has to give a finite variance. From this it can be concluded that deviations form the equilibrium are stationary.
